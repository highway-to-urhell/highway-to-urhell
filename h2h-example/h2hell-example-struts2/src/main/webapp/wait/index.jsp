    <h1>Execute and Wait Examples</h1>

    These examples illustrate Struts build in support for execute and wait.
    <p/>
    When you have a process that takes a long time your users can be impatient and starts to submit/click again.
    <br/> A good solution is to show the user a progress page (wait page) while the process takes it time.

    <br/>
    <br/><a href="example1.jsp">Example 1 (no delay)</a>
    <br/><a href="example2.jsp">Example 2 (with delay)</a>
    <br/><a href="example3.jsp">Example 2 (with longer check delay)</a>
