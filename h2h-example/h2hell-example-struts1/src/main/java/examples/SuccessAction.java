/**
 * <p>An Action that forwards control via a "success" ActionFoward.</p>
 *
 * <p>A recommended strategy is that view pages should link only to Actions and
 * never directly to other views. In situations where the view does not require
 * any preparation you can use a SuccessAction, specifying the view as an
 * ActionForward named "success" in your action mapping.</p>
 *
 * <p>e.g. If you configure an ActionMapping in struts-config.xml like this:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *    &lt;action path="/prepareView"
 *            type="examples.SuccessAction"&gt;
 *        &lt;forward name="success" path="/jsp/View.jsp"/&gt;
 *    &lt/action&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>You could create a link to the view (via the Action) as follows:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     &lt;html:link action="/prepareView"&gt;Display 'view' page&lt;/html:link&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If you later change your application such that the view page requires some
 * initialization you can change a single ActionMapping definition in
 * struts-config.xml rather than lots of link definitions in many JSPs.</p>
