<p>The form has been submitted.</p>
<p>You can cause a duplicate submission by either: 
<ol>
<li>Using your browser back button to return to the previous page and resubmitting the form.</li>
<li>Refeshing this page and selecting OK when your browser asks if you want to resubmit the data.</li>
</ol>
In either case, the input form page will be displayed, along with an error message explaining that the form has been submitted out of sequence.

<p><strong>Important:</strong> This example demonstrates how you can prevent <em>unintentional</em> form resubmission. 
The token is reset before the input form is redisplayed. This means that once the user has been notified of the attempted
duplicate submission they can then <em>choose</em> whether to resubmit the form.</p>
